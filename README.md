## Game Design and development

- The game is ment to give the impression of a Ship going through some sort of tunnel sorting different obstacles.
- It is divided on different Scenes, each one with its own function. 
- When the game runs , players will see who has the current max score , and are able to start the game.
- When the play icon is pressed, the user is taken to a scene where he is explained how to play the game , and from there he can start the actual game.
- The ship goes up, and the idea  of the game is to dodge the coloured barriers , while getting the white ones. It is posible to take the ship down , but it makes the barries speed to go up. 
- After the player Loses, he/she is prompted to inser his name, and taken to the Game Over screen, from where he can see the leader board , or restart the game. 
- if he-she decides to click the leaderboard icon, it will take him/her to the leaderboards screen, from where he can re start the game again.
